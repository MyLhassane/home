        <h2>Webpages explained gradually.</h2>



        <p>Let's start with the basics and gradually build up from there.</p>

        <h3>At its most basic level</h3>

        <p>A website is a collection of interconnected web pages that can be accessed on the internet.</p>

        <p>These web pages contain text, images, videos, and other media that are organized in a way that provides information or functionality to the user.</p>

        <p>Websites are typically created using a combination of markup languages, such as:</p>

         <ul>
          <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</li>
           <li>And CSS (Cascading Style Sheets),</li>
           <li>As well as programming languages, such as JavaScript or PHP.</li>
         </ul>
  
        <p>These languages allow website creators to design and structure the content on their website in a way that is both visually appealing and functional.</p>
  
        <p>When you enter a website's URL into your web browser, the browser sends a request to the website's server. The server then responds with the appropriate web page or pages, which are displayed in your browser. The web pages may be static, meaning they don't change, or dynamic, meaning they change based on user input or other factors.</p>

        <p>Websites can be used for a variety of purposes, such as providing information, selling products or services, or allowing users to interact with one another. They can be created by individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments.</p>

        <p>As websites have evolved over time, they have become more complex and sophisticated. Some websites now include features such as user accounts, personalized content, and e-commerce functionality. Others may incorporate multimedia elements, such as audio or video, or use advanced web technologies like AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to provide a more interactive user experience.</p>

        <p>Overall, websites have become an essential part of the modern world, providing people with access to information, entertainment, and a vast array of online services.</p>

        <h2>Websites development types</h2>

        <h3>Static websites:</h3>
        
        <p>Static websites are basic, simple websites that contain a set of fixed pages. They are ideal for small businesses or individuals who need a simple online presence. The content on these websites remains the same every time they are accessed, unless the website's code is updated by a developer.</p>
       
        <h3>Dynamic Custom Websites:</h3>
        
        <p>Dynamic custom websites are websites that are designed and built from scratch for a specific purpose or to meet unique business requirements. They offer a more customized and interactive experience than static websites and are built using server-side programming languages such as PHP, Ruby on Rails, or ASP.NET. and the JavaScript too.</p>
        
        <h3>CMS (Content Management System) Websites:</h3>
        
        <p>CMS websites are websites that use a pre-built platform, such as WordPress, to manage and organize content. They offer a more user-friendly approach to website building, allowing users to easily update and manage their website without having to know how to code. CMS websites are a good option for businesses and organizations that need to regularly update their content and want a simple, efficient way to do so.</p>

        <h3>Blogs:</h3>
        
        <p>A blog is a type of website that is updated frequently with new posts, and it is often used as a platform for sharing thoughts, opinions, or news.</p>
        
        <h3>Social Networking Websites:</h3>

        <h3>Government Websites:</h3>
        
        <p>These websites provide information and resources for citizens, and they often include information about government services, laws, and policies.</p>
